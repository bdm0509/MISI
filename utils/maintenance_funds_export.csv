However, they DO share the cost of the common expenses which include (1) Landscape bill @ $39.78 per month per unit and (2) electricity for the main entrance gate which is $2.50 per month but is billed in arrears twice yearly totaling $15.00 per six months.

Both bills are paid by Mr. Avila personally, so each owner remits their checks payable to Antonio Avila.

For this closing, proposed for Friday, 8-30-13, collect September landscape @ $39.48 from the new owner payable to Antonio Avila.  As for the electricity, the next billing for approximately $15.00 per owner will be December 2013 for July, 2013 through December 2013.  You may credit the buyer for the sellers portion through the closing date.  The buyer will receive a bill late 2013 for that service and should remitted payable to Antonio Avila. 

IMPORTANT NOTE BELOW FROM THE OWNERS REPRESENTATIVE TO SHARE WITH THE BUYERS IF THE SELLER HAS NOT ALREADY DONE SO:
 
""One other requirement that is worth mentioning now is that there is a parking spot inside the gate that belongs to my (Mr. Avila) property per the property survey.  All the neighbors know this but has caused some confusion in the past and with some recent tenants that have joined the property.  In order to avoid any confusion in the future, I think it is important to mention this to the buyer from the beginning.

""There is no official HOA. I owned and managed all of the shared expenses between the 3 town homes in the community. The other units would give me an amount which I would deduct from every time there is an expense. We are going to settle with those units on their balances when we sell the house. Then, the 3 of the owners, including the buyers, can decide which one is going to manage the shared expenses.

Here are some notes on how our community manages the expenses. 

1) Gate Electricity Bill - is a little under $10 per month divided by three.  It is currently in my name with Reliant but can be transferred to anyone.

2) Lawn - The current provider charges $27 per visit and comes every two weeks but the community can change the provider if they deem necessary. We have bit greater share of the lawn costs than the other two as we own a bit more of the lawn. Approximately 40/30/30% split.

3) Any other discrete expenses are discussed among the community and costs are shared.  Examples of previous shared costs include painting the gate less than two years ago, driveway lights, weed killer liquid and gate motor re-key.""

I have filled out the information below to the best of my ability.  Also to help the buyers, I have attached a spreadsheet that went to each of the homeowners in our little hood to show the expenses and their allocation.  For example you will see that the lawn fee is for the 6 homes that make up 1811 an 1815 Potomac, whereas the electricity and the phones for the gates are shared by 9 homes -- 1811, 1815 and 1901.   We then have a one time expenses it is allocated based on which homes benefit from the expense -- i.e. gate repair, etc..  A homeowner typically picks up the expense and then we reconcile and adjust when we sent out the next year assessment. 

I hope this helps.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or if the buyers have any questions I will do my best to answer.  We all work together in our little gated neighborhood to keep costs low but ensure that the value of our homes remains high.
